## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Considerations

### Data Limitations
- **Geographic Scope**: Weather data from single location (LaGuardia Airport)
- **Temporal Aggregation**: Daily weather averages may mask intraday variations
- **Sample Representation**: Jersey City data may not fully represent broader NYC patterns
- **Simulated Data**: Core analysis uses realistic but simulated trip data for demonstration

### Technical Considerations
- **API Dependencies**: Analysis relies on Open-Meteo API availability
- **Processing Requirements**: Large dataset processing may require adequate memory
- **Reproducibility**: All random seeds set for consistent results across runs
