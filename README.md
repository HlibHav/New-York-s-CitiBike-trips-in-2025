#### Analysis Components
1. **Enhanced Weather Feature Engineering**:
   - Time-specific temperature analysis (morning, afternoon, evening)
   - Precipitation categorization (rain vs. snow vs. mixed)
   - Wind pattern analysis with gust detection
   - Comfort index calculations for cycling conditions
   
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Hourly, daily, and seasonal usage patterns
3. **Weather Impact Assessment**: Multi-dimensional weather condition effects
4. **Rider Segmentation**: Member vs. casual rider behavior analysis
5. **Station Performance**: Popular routes and station demand patterns
6. **Predictive Modeling**: Weather-based demand forecasting with enhanced features

## üìà Key Insights

- **Optimal Temperature**: Peak ridership occurs at 20-25¬∞C (68-77¬∞F)
- **Weather Sensitivity**: Strong positive correlation (r=0.778) between temperature and daily trips
- **Seasonal Variation**: Summer months (June-August) show highest usage
- **Member Loyalty**: Members show less weather sensitivity than casual riders
- **Peak Hours**: Morning (7-9 AM) and evening (5-7 PM) commute times
- **Precipitation Impact**: Moderate negative correlation (r=-0.356) with daily ridership
- **Comfort Index Correlation**: Cycling comfort index shows strong predictive power for ridership
- **Wind Effect**: High wind speeds (>15 m/s) significantly reduce casual rider usage
- **Time-of-Day Weather Sensitivity**: Evening temperatures more predictive than morning for commuter patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Next Steps
### üìä Data Limitations Temporal Considerations
- Leap Year Handling : 2024 is a leap year with February 29th. The analysis includes this extra day, which may slightly skew monthly averages and seasonal comparisons with non-leap years
- Data Completeness : Analysis assumes complete data coverage for all dates, but potential gaps in trip data or weather API responses could affect correlation accuracy
- Timezone Consistency : All timestamps are standardized to America/New_York timezone, but original data sources may have inconsistent timezone handling Geographic & Location Assumptions
- Single Weather Station : Weather data is sourced exclusively from LaGuardia Airport (40.7769¬∞N, 73.8740¬∞W), which may not represent microclimatic conditions across all NYC boroughs
- Urban Heat Island Effect : Airport weather data may not capture the urban heat island effect experienced in dense city areas where most bike stations are located
- Elevation Differences : LaGuardia Airport is at sea level, while NYC has varying elevations that could affect local weather conditions
- Distance Bias : Weather conditions at LaGuardia may differ significantly from conditions in Manhattan, Brooklyn, or other boroughs (up to 20+ miles away) Methodological Biases
- Correlation vs. Causation : Strong correlations between weather and ridership don't necessarily imply direct causation; other factors (events, holidays, infrastructure changes) may confound results
- Seasonal Confounding : Weather patterns correlate with other seasonal factors (school schedules, tourism, daylight hours) that independently affect bike usage
- Sample Bias : Jersey City CitiBike data (JC-prefix files) may not fully represent broader NYC CitiBike system patterns
- Temporal Aggregation : Daily weather averages may mask important intraday weather variations that affect commuting decisions Technical Limitations
- API Dependencies : Analysis relies on Open-Meteo API availability and rate limits, which could affect reproducibility
- Data Processing : Large dataset processing may encounter memory limitations on standard hardware
- Weather Code Interpretation : Weather condition codes from Open-Meteo may not perfectly align with user-perceived cycling conditions
